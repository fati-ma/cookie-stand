# Lab: 08 b 

## Add a constructor function to the cookie stand project

### In this lab I first created a new branch for it, it has all the changes from lab 06.

### I replaced all of lab 06's obhect literals with a single constructor function that, when called with the ‘new’ keyword, it creates a new instance for the 5 objects in the lab ['Seattle', 'Tokyo', 'Dubai', 'Paris', 'Lima']

### Then I replace the lists of the objects' data for each store and built a single table of data instead.
